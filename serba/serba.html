      SERBA <br> Boundary Element Method for Elasticity
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SERBA</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      applies the boundary element
      method to solve the elasticify equation in a 2D region,
      by Federico Paris and Jose Canas.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program uses linear continuous elements, and any kind of
      combination of boundary conditions in stresses and displacements
      can be considered.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Input File Format:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The input to the program involves a file containing seven sets of data:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The title line (a character string)
        </li>
        <li>
          The parameter line, listing <b>NP</b>, <b>NPI</b> and <b>NANU</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>NP</b> is the number of elements used to discretize the boundary;
              This is also the number of boundary points.
              This value must be positive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>NPI</b> is the number of internal points where the displacement
              and stress will be computed;  <b>NPI</b> can be zero if no information
              about interior points is desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>IANUL</b> is the number of components of displacements that are
              going to be fixed, regardless of the boundary conditions.  This number
              should only be nonzero in cases where the specified boundary conditions
              do not eliminate a rigid body motion;
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Elastic properties are specified on one line:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>NTIP</b> is 0 for plane strain, or else 1 for plane stress;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>E</b> is the value of Young's modulus;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>POIS</b> is the value of Poisson's ratio;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DM</b> is the maximum (spatial) dimension of the problem to be solved;
              It is used for scaling.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The coordinates of internal points;  For each of the <b>NPI</b> internal
          points, there must be a record specifying <b>XINT(I)</b> and <b>YINT(I)</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>XINT(I)</b> is the X coordinate of the I-th internal point;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>YINT(I)</b> is the Y coordinate of the I-th internal point;
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The coordinates of boundary points;  The boundary points are indexed from 1 to
          <b>NP+1</b>, and are assumed to be given in counterclockwise order;
          Logically, the boundary point information is given consecutively;
          however, if one or more points are omitted, their values will be determined
          by linear interpolation from the preceding and succeeding values that are
          given.  Thus, the very least input would specify points 1 and <b>NP+1</b>;
          the fullest information would specify all <b>NP+1</b> points.  Most input
          would omit points that are interior to an equally spaced line.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>I</b>, the index of the boundary point.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>X(I)</b> is the X coordinate of the I-th boundary point;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Y(I)</b> is the Y coordinate of the I-th boundary point;
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The boundary conditions, specifying the boundary node index, the boundary
          code, and the values of the potential, and the "before" and "after" fluxes
          at the node.  A typical boundary condition will only specify the potential
          or the flux; the values not specified can be given as 0.  A boundary condition
          must be given for every boundary node.  Logically, the boundary nodes are
          input in order; however boundary nodes may be omitted, in which case
          the data will be linearly interpolated; however, the preceding and succeeding
          boundary conditions must have the same value of <b>NCOD</b> for this to be done.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>I</b>, the index of the boundary point.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>I1</b>, the code for boundary condition 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>V1</b> the value for boundary condition 1 (displacement or stress
              component)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>I2</b>, the code for boundary condition 2.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>V2</b> the value for boundary condition 2 (displacement or stress
              component)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>I3</b>, the code for boundary condition 3.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>V3</b> the value for boundary condition 3 (displacement or stress
              component)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>I4</b>, the code for boundary condition 4.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>V4</b> the value for boundary condition 4 (displacement or stress
              component)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Support conditions on one line, if IANUL is nonzero.  In this case,
          the positions of the displacements to be fixed must be given.  Supposing
          the number of nodes is <b>NP</b>, then the horizontal displacement of
          node I is fixed by specifying I, while the vertical displacement is
          fixed by specifying I+NP.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>NANU(1)</b> is I to fix the horizontal displacement at node I,
              or I+NP to fix the vertical displacement at node I.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>...</b> intermediate values;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>NANU(IANUL)</b> is I to fix the horizontal displacement at node I,
              or I+NP to fix the vertical displacement at node I.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      The boundary condition codes are required to indicate which of 8 possible
      items are being specified.
      Displacements and stress components are given in local coordinates, based
      on the normal to the boundary, and the anticlockwise tangent vector.  There
      are eight possible variables at a node, with only four of them being known.
      The paramters I1, I2, I3 and I4, which must be given in ascending order,
      take values between 1 and 8, identifying the boundary condition.  The
      meanings of the eight possible codes for boundary conditions are:
      <ol>
        <li>
          normal displacement of the node corresponding to the element before the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          tangential displacement at the node corresponding to the element before the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          normal displacement of the node corresponding to the element after the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          tangential displacement at the node corresponding to the element after the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          normal stress component of the node corresponding to the element before the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          tangential stress component of the node corresponding to the element before the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          normal stress component of the node corresponding to the element after the node.
        </li>
        <li>
          tangential stress component of the node corresponding to the element after the node.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote><code>
        <b>serba</b>
      </code></blockquote>
      The user will be prompted for
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>namedat</b>, the name of the input file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>namesal</b>, the name of the output file; (note that the program
          will terminate if there is already a file named <b>namesal</b>).
          The program will not overwrite an output file, so it is the user's
          responsibility to delete an old, unwanted file of the same name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>igauss</b>, the number of points to use in the Gauss quadrature rule.
          a value of 4 is often sufficient.  This value must be between 1 and 50.
        </li>
      </ul>
