      TCELL <br> Generate Navier Stokes solutions in TCELL region.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TCELL</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      solves the time-dependent Navier Stokes equations in a
      two dimensional region called the "T Cell",
      by Hyung-Chun Lee.
    </p>

    <p>
      As time increases, other flow parameters may be varied as well.
      For this code, the flow parameter that can vary is the magnitude
      of the inflow specified at the left boundary.
      The program stores the results of each timestep in a file.
      Each solution may be thought of as a "snapshot" of the gradual
      evolution of the flow field over time.
      In a typical run, 500 such files might be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      A collection of snapshot files may be analyzed to seek a small
      underlying basis of fundamental flows.  This basis may be used
      to approximate the entire set, or indeed to generate a reduced basis
      program that can quickly and cheaply compute new flow solutions
      whose flow parameters vary in small ways from those of the original
      set.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "T-Cell" region is a T-shaped region contained in a subset
      of the unit square [01]x[01].  The top half of the region is a
      channel open to the left and right, with a rectangular recess in
      the bottom.  The left channel opening extends from [0.0,0.5] to
      [0.0,1.0], and the right channel from [1.0,0.5] to [1.0,1.0].
      The recess is a square, whose bottom extends from [0.25,0.0] to
      [0.75,0.0], and which extends upward to meet the channel.

      The grid can be thought of as being generated by a uniform 81 by 81
      uniformly spaced grid of nodes, from which the nodes corresponding to
      the two voids have been deleted.  This leaves 4,961 nodes.
      These nodes are organized into 2400 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.

      <b>RUN1</b> is a run of the program used to generated "snapshots", which

      are varied in a way that is intended to make the system exhibit
      many varied behaviors.  (Right now, to change the boundary conditions
