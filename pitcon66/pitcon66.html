      PITCON66 <br> Continuation Code for Parameterized Nonlinear Equations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PITCON66</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      carries out the continuation method for producing a series of
      solutions of a set of nonlinear equations with one degree of freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is designed for problems in which <b>N</b> variables <b>X</b>
      are constrained by <b>N</b>-1 nonlinear equations <b>F(X)=0</b>.
      Generally, there is an entire family of solutions to such a problem,
      which can be thought of as a curve in <b>N</b>-dimensional space.
      We can imagine this curve parameterized by a variable <b>LAMBDA</b>.
      Given one solution <b>(X,LAMBDA0)</b>, the program attempts to determine
      more points on the curve of solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PITCON66</b> is a revision of the continuation code originally
      published as ACM TOMS algorithm 596.  The revisions to the code have
      corrected a problem that occurred because it was assumed that local
      variables were automatically saved between calls.  Other modifications
      and improvements have been made.

      <b>PITCON66_PRB3</b> sets up a two point boundary value problem with a parameter,
      LAMBDA, and variable number set to N = 22.  (This problem can easily be modified
      to use larger values of N).  This problem
      has a limit point in the LAMBDA parameter, which we seek.  We
      solve this problem 6 times, illustrating the use of full and banded
      jacobians, and of user-generated, or forward or central difference
      approximated jacobian matrices.  The program seeks limit points in LAMBDA.

      This time, we do NOT seek the limit point in the LAMBDA parameter,
      but rather the two target points where LAMBDA=0.8, which occurs twice,
      before and after LAMBDA "goes around the bend".

      This version of the problem demonstrates the jacobian checking option.
      Two runs are made.  Each is allowed only five steps.  The first
      run is with the correct jacobian.  The second run uses a defective
      jacobian, and demonstrates not only the jacobian checker, but also
      shows that "slightly" bad jacobians can cause the Newton convergence
      to become linear rather than quadratic.
