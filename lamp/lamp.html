      LAMP <br> Linear Assignment and Matching Problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LAMP</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      implements various algorithms for linear assignment and matching problems,
      by Rainer Burkard, Ulrich Derigs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problems that are considered include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the linear sum assignment problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the linear bottleneck assignment problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the cardinality matching problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the sum matching problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the bottleneck matching problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the Chinese postman problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the quadratic assignment problem;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program printed in the reference is written in FORTRAN IV.  People who
      think FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN66 was primitive should take a look at this source
      code, to understand the evolution of programming.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The FORTRAN IV code does not use doubly dimensioned arrays; instead,
          MxN information is packed into a vector, and retrieved by computing
          the linear address I+J*M from the 2D (I,J) address.
        </li>
        <li>
          The index of a vector was required to be a variable, not a variable
          expression.  Even an expression like "X(I+1)" was illegal,
          and a variable had to be set aside to store the value of I+1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because a DO loop would always be executed at least once, many
          such loops had to be protected by conditional jumps around them,
          in case the lower limit of the loop was greater than the upper limit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmers thought nothing of running a DO loop with index I, say,
          and jumping out of it when some condition occurred, and assuming
          that the value of I was preserved and available.  Many compilers
          now regard this as an unsafe assumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another "cultural" issue was that programmers thought nothing of
          jumping out of a loop via a GOTO statement, doing some calculation,
          and then jumping back into the loop.  Modern compilers produce
          warnings that this is an unsafe practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only way to form a compound statement was with statement labels.
          There was no DO/ENDDO or IF/ENDIF structure; there were only GOTO's.
          The extraordinarily ugly appearance of the resulting code, and the
          difficulty of comprehending the bizarre-looking text, is impossible
          to suggest.  One must look at such code and struggle to understand it
          and then realize the advantage of simple modern control structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Typing in the code, I was reminded yet again of the biggest horror
          of old FORTRAN, namely the fixed format scheme in which columns 7 through
          72 were for text, column 6 (remember not to use '0' for continuation!)
          was for continuation, and columns 1 through 5 for statement labels,
          and 73 to 80 sequence numbers (remember those?).  Accidentally violating
          these rules could result in deadly but silent bugs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To some extent, the code has been "cleaned up", so that it is not a
      straight copy of the printed text.
