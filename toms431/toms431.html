      TOMS431 <br>
      A Computer Routine for Quadratic and Linear Programming Problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TOMS431</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      implements ACM TOMS algorithm 431, for solving linear and
      quadratic programming problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is set up to solve a complementary problem, and it
      is the user's responsibility to rearrange the data for the
      linear or quadratic programming problem into a form suitable for
      the complementary problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear programming problem is
      <pre>
        Find an <b>N</b> vector <b>x</b> solving the problem:
        <b>
          Minimize Z = c' * x
          subject to
            b &lt;= A * x,
            0 &lt; x.
        </b>
        where <b>A</b> is a given <b>M</b> x <b>N</b> matrix and
        <b>b</b> is a given <b>M</b> vector.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The quadratic programming problem is
      <pre>
        Find an <b>N</b> vector <b>x</b> solving the problem:
        <b>
          Minimize Z = c' * x + x' * Q * x
          subject to
            b &lt;= A * x,
            0 &lt; x.
        </b>
        where <b>A</b> is a given <b>M</b> x <b>N</b> matrix, <b>c</b>
        is a given <b>N</b> vector, <b>Q</b> is a given <b>N</b> by <b>N</b> matrix,
        and <b>b</b> is a given <b>M</b> vector.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The complementary problem is
      <pre>
        Find nonnegative <b>N</b> vectors <b>w</b> and <b>z</b> so that
        <b>
          w = M * z + q
          w' * z = 0
        </b>
        where <b>M</b> is a given <b>N</b> x <b>N</b> matrix and <b>q</b> is a
        given <b>N</b> vector.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      An optimal solution to the quadratic programming problem
      may be obtained by solving a complementary problem of the form
      <pre><b>
        ( v ) = ( Q + Q'   -A' ) ( x ) + (  c )
        ( u )   (   A       0  ) ( y )   ( -b )
      </b></pre>
      with nonegative <b>u</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>y</b> and
      requiring <b>(v,u)' * (x,y)</b> = 0, where <b>u</b> denotes the
      slack variables of the quadratic program and <b>(y,v)</b>
      denotes the variables of the dual problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, the data for the quadratic programming problem can
      be rearranged for the complementary problem by setting
      <pre><b>
        w = ( v, u )'

        z = ( x, y )'

        M = ( Q + Q'  -A' )
            (   A      0  )

        q = ( c, -b )'
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The data for the linear programming problem can
      be rearranged for the complementary problem by setting
      <pre><b>
        w = ( v, u )'

        z = ( x, y )'

        M = (   0     -A' )
            (   A      0  )

        q = ( c, -b )'

      While the text of many ACM TOMS algorithms is available online
      through ACM:

      or NETLIB:
      <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html">
      http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html</a>, most of the early
      algorithms are not available.  This is one of them.  I typed it
      in.

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>toms431</b> &lt; <i>input_file</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          where <i>input_file</i> contains the following records:
          <pre>
            XX   <- IP, the number of problems to solve, in I2 format.
            XX   <- N1, the order of the matrix for problem #1, in I2 format.
            AAAA.aaaaaBBBB.bbbbbCCCC.cccccDDDD.dddddEEEE.eeeeeFFFF.fffffGGGG.ggggg
                 <-- the first COLUMN of the matrix, using 7F10.5 format.
                     (if N1 is more than 7, use as many more
                     input lines as necessary.)
                 <-- followed by COLUMNS 2 through N1.
            AAAA.aaaaaBBBB.bbbbbCCCC.cccccDDDD.dddddEEEE.eeeeeFFFF.fffffGGGG.ggggg
                 <-- the N1 entries of the Q vector.  (For a linear programming
                 problem, set all entries of Q to 0.)
            XX   <-  N2, the order of the matrix for problem #2, in I2 format.
                 More data for problem 2, 3, and so on.
