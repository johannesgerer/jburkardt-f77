    <p>
      <b>DRIV</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      includes solvers for systems of real or complex ordinary differential
      equations,
      by Kahaner and Sutherland.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three levels of interface to the package are available, ranging
      from "easy" to "hard", allowing the user to rely on default values
      for various program parameters, or to tune them as necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      While primarily intended for systems of the form
      <blockquote><code>
        Y'=F(T,Y),
      </code></blockquote>
      the package can handle implicit problems
      <blockquote><code>
        A(T,Y) * Y' = F(T,Y),
      </code></blockquote>
      and mixed systems of
      differential and algebraic equations.  Moreover, stiffness can be
      handled by requesting a Gear method, or by having the program itself
      watch out for stiffness and choose a Gear method itself.
