    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TOMS437</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      implements ACM TOMS algorithm 437, which carries out a
      product type Simpson's integration to estimate the integral
      from A to B of F(X) * G(X).
    </p>

    <p>
      While the text of many ACM TOMS algorithms is available online
      through ACM:
              <a href = "http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo/">
                         http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo</a>
      or NETLIB:
      <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html">
      http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html</a>, most of the early
      algorithms are not available.  This is one of them.  I typed it
      in.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>call psimp ( a, b, n, fn, gn, vint )</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          where <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are the left and right endpoints
          of the interval, <b>N</b> is the number of times the
          rule is to be compounded, <b>FN</b> and <b>GN</b> are external
          functions for evaluating the integrand factors, and <b>VINT</b>
          is returned as the estimated value of the integral of
          <b>FN(X)</b> * <b>GN(X)</b> from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
