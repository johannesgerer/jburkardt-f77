    <p>
      <b>TCELL_MASS</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      computes and saves
      mass matrix associated with a finite element approximation of
      the fluid velocity in the time-dependent Navier Stokes equations
      in a region called the "T-Cell",
      by Hyung-Chun Lee.
    </p>

    <p>
      The actual simulation of successive solutions to the flow problem
      can be done by
      <a href =
      "../../f77_src/tcell/tcell.html">
      the TCELL program</a>, which automatically builds and uses the
      mass matrix.  However, what <b>TCELL_MASS</b> does is allow us
      to "export" the information about the mass matrix (and several
      other important quantities) so that a reduced order model of
      the TCELL flow problem can be solved.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, enough information about the reduced order model will
      be saved so that the resulting system can be solved by a simple
      program that invokes a MATLAB ODE solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "T-Cell" region is a T-shaped region contained in a subset
      of the unit square [01]x[01].  The top half of the region is a
      channel open to the left and right, with a rectangular recess in
      the bottom.  The left channel opening extends from [0.0,0.5] to
      [0.0,1.0], and the right channel from [1.0,0.5] to [1.0,1.0].
      The recess is a square, whose bottom extends from [0.25,0.0] to
      [0.75,0.0], and which extends upward to meet the channel.

      The grid can be thought of as being generated by a uniform 81 by 81
      uniformly spaced grid of nodes, from which the nodes corresponding to
      the two voids have been deleted.  This leaves 4,961 nodes.
      These nodes are organized into 2400 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.
